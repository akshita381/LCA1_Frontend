# Uber Clone Project
A simplified clone of the Uber interface, focusing on UI/UX design principles.

## Overview
This project aims to replicate the basic functionality and design of the Uber app's home page for UI/UX Design course MIT SY SOD. It includes features such as a navigation bar, a centered logo, a "Book a Ride" button, and a form to input pickup and drop locations.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: Includes links to Home and About pages.
- **Centered Logo**: Displays the Uber logo (or a placeholder) in the center of the page.
- **Interactive Booking Form**: Allows users to input pickup and drop locations.
- **Confirmation Message**: Displays a confirmation message after submitting the form.
- **About Page**: Provides information about the developer and the project.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **External CSS File**: For maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open Files**: Open `main.html` and `about.html` in a web browser to view the project.
3. **View Source**: Inspect the source code to understand the implementation details.

## Project Structure

- **main.html**: The main page of the Uber Clone, featuring the logo and booking form.
- **about.html**: The about page, providing information about the developer.
- **styles.css**: An external CSS file containing all styles for both pages.

## How It Works

3. **CSS Styling**: Added styles using an external CSS file for better organization.

## Future Improvements
